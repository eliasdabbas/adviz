<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->
<p>The <a href="https://eliasdabbas.github.io/adviz/ecdf.html#ecdf"><code>ecdf</code></a> function is a thin wrapper for the <code>plotly.express</code> function of the same name. It adds a few minor options to it.</p>
<p>It can be used to visualize how numeric variables are distributed, both using a histogram, as well the cumulative distribution (ecdf: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function">empirical cumulative distribution function</a>).</p>
<p>While the histogram shows us how many observations we have for each interval, the ecdf shows each observation and its particular position in the ranking order.</p>
<p>Note that you have access to all the parameters of the <a href="https://eliasdabbas.github.io/adviz/ecdf.html#ecdf"><code>ecdf</code></a> function, so please check them if you want to see what else can be modified with:</p>

<p>In other words, the keyword “api serp analysis” generated more impressions than 99.6% of the items in the list. There are 6,886 keywords with less impressions, and 25 keywords with more impressions (out of a total of 6,912 keywords).</p>
<p>Keywords up to this point have generated a total of 501,328 impressions, which is 75.1% of the sum of all impressions of all keywords.</p>
<p>In other cases the distribution can be much more extreme, as is the case in some examples below.</p>
<p>The aim is to show how (in)significant a set of values are in the dataset.</p>
<p>Mousing over any of the circles you see the query it represents, the value represented (impressions in this case), how many other observations are equal-to or below it as a percentage, and also the counts of observations above and below.</p>

<p>Let’s do the same with URLs in an XML sitemap. We can visualize the cumulative distribution of the <code>loc</code> tags, and give it more context by showing each URL when we mouseover. This becomes a rich report with a lot of data on each URL.</p>
<p>We can immediately see in the above chart that the content on this website spans the period September 2023 - June 2024. We can clearly see that most updates happened in the first periods by looking at the top histogram.</p>
<p>When we have a vertically looking set of dots, we know that there were many updates happening in a very short period of time. These are likely being updated in a batch.</p>
<p>With a simple option we can split and color the chart by the website segment.</p>
<p>I took the top five values in <code>/dir_1/</code> and labelled all other values as “Others”.</p>
<p>By using <code>facet_row="segment"</code> we have six charts showing us the trend for each segment of the website separately.</p>
